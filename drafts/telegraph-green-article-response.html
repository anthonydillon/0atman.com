                <p>Yesterday <em>The Telegraph</em> published an articled titled <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/green-party/11356354/Drugs-brothels-al-Qaeda-and-the-Beyonce-tax-the-Green-Party-plan-for-Britain.html">Drugs, brothels, al-Qaeda and the Beyonce tax: the Green Party plan for&nbsp;Britain</a> </p>
<p>The core principle that seems to unite these disparate policies, and seemingly controversial policies is global thinking. Lets analyse each of <em>The Telegraph</em>&#8216;s bugbears one at a&nbsp;time:</p>
<h1>The&nbsp;Economy</h1>
<ul>
<li>Caroline Lucas and colleagues regard economic growth as incompatible with protecting the planet and a fulfilling personal life.
<code>a fact that is hard to dispute</code></li>
<li>
<p>While their rivals recognise more trade, more innovation, more competition and more globalisation as an engine for prosperity for everyone on the planet, the Greens argue it is nothing more than a race to the bottom that has made the poor poorer, the rich richer, and pillaged the&nbsp;environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party’s manifesto argues for zero, or even negative growth and falling levels of personal consumption. Britain would be in permanent recession; families would become materially poorer each year. After centuries of growing global connectivity, the Greens want to see greater national self-reliance.
<code>while maximising personal consumption is good for one person, thinking on a global scale requires checking the developing world's runaway economies.</code></p>
</li>
<li>And while Labour and the Tories compete on job creation, the Greens argue that government policy should make paid work “less necessary”, with people making their living from the home-based “informal economy”.
<code>It's ALMOST LIKE the greens care about humanity's well-being, not "the economy".</code></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1><span class="caps">UBI</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>The flagship policy is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income of £71 a week for everyone living in Britain “as a right of citizenship”, regardless of wealth or whether they are seeking work.
<code>I'm completely on-board with UBI, Switzerland is holding a referendum to introduce it in March</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Tax</h1>
<p><em>The great equaliser</em>
  - Under Green plans, inheritance tax – “to prevent the accumulation of wealth and power by a privileged class” – will no longer just tax the dead.
<code>To close the loopholes (like gifting) that allow dynasties to hoard wealth</code>
  - New, higher rates of income tax will be imposed.
<code>Cleverly ignored is the fact that it is higher-earners who will be taxed more</code>
  - <span class="caps">VAT</span> will be abolished – and replaced with new levies based on how much environmental damage a product causes. New resource taxes would apply to wood, metal and minerals, and steeper levies imposed on cars.
<code>This already happens in the current convoluted VAT system. For instance, there is a long list of professions that get different tax breaks. A butcher, for example, charges her customers full-VAT, but only pays 8% back to the government.
Taxing things that are bad for society (eg. alcohol, cigarettes) is not a new thing.</code></p>
<h1>Crime <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Punishment</h1>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Evidence-based&#8221;
  - The trade and cultivation of cannabis will be decriminalised under Green policy, along with possession of Class A and B drugs for personal use. 
<code>Good, the war on drugs has gone on long enough. Declassification won't make people take more drugs, they have always been available to those who want them, from students to stock brokers.
This will simply make it easier to regulate the industry and provide safety for our people. Not to mention the tax that can be levied.</code>
  - Higher taxes will be brought in on alcohol and tobacco, and a complete alcohol advertising ban imposed.
<code>If you want to see the two most damaging drugs for sale, pop into your local Tesco.</code>
  - All elements of the sex industry will be decriminalised, and prostitutes could no longer be discriminated against in child custody cases.
<code>It's ALMOST LIKE prostitutes are humans too. Time to stop the persecution of the oldest profession.</code>
  - The Greens also want to see “significantly reduced” levels of imprisonment, with jail only used when there is a “substantial risk of a further grave crime” or in cases where offences are so horrific that offenders would be at risk of vigilantes. Prisoners will be given the vote.
<code>This is called an "Evidence-based" prison system. The problem with prisons for rehabilitation is they don't work and have never worked. Prisons do one thing and only one thing well: separate people from society. The resistivity rate is astonishing. We must keep our people out of prisons at all costs, because they come out changed, to everyone's detriment.</code></p>
<h1>Education</h1>
<p><em>Unbiased higher education for all</em>
  - Large schools will be broken up, to have no more than 700 pupils. <span class="caps">SATS</span>, early years tests and league tables will be abolished, and “creative” subjects given equal parity to the “academic”.
<code>Two issues here, firstly, constant examination does nothing but prepare students to pass exams. Secondly the idiotic implication that "academic" subjects are more important than "creative". Our current curriculum, created decades ago, is preparing our young people for a world that does not exist anymore. A balanced education is the only way to ensure they are ready for whatever future industries come out of the rapidly-changing technological world they will grow into.</code>
  - Independent schools will lose their charitable status and pay corporation tax, while church schools will be stripped of taxpayer funding. Religious instruction will be banned in school hours.
<code>Independent schools are, on paper, identical to corporations in that they turn a profit over to a group of investors. Time to tax them like one. Church schools do not serve their students well, are implicitly discriminatory and have no business in a modern UK.</code>
  - Tuition fees will be abolished - but state research funding for universities will increase to reduce a reliance on “biased” commercial research.
<code>It is impossible to see how universal education could be a bad thing. (Good use of quotation marks here by The Telegraph, distancing themselves from the crazy notion that companies pay for favourable research.)</code>
  - The <span class="caps">BBC</span> will be forced to show educational programming during prime time, giving it “equal precedence” to entertainment shows and not “ghettoised at inconvenient times”.
<code>Good, I like David Attenborough.</code></p>
<h1>Media</h1>
<p><em>Beat the raptor</em>
  - Foreign companies will be stripped of newspapers and television shows if they control too much of the market.
 <code>Advertising has an enormous ability to influence us in very subtle ways. (Go find out what "supernormal stimulation" is and then be horrified when you see it everywhere)</code>
  - The “overall volume” of advertising on <span class="caps">TV</span> and newspapers will be controlled and cut, as part of a war on the “materialist and consumption driven culture which is not sustainable”.
<code>As a counterexample, I challenge you to sit through an hour of US broadcast TV, with 20 minutes of actual content in.</code></p>
<h1>Energy</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Greens will aim for all energy to be supplied from renewables, with wind the main source of power by 2030.
<code>An ambitious goal! Let me put it another way: the UK wouldn't be dependant on foreign fossil fuels by 2030. Sounds pretty good now, right?</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Transport</h1>
<ul>
<li>Under a new hierarchy for transport, pedestrians and bikes come first – and aeroplanes last.
 <code>We've seen amazing programmes rolled out in European cities, lets get those here too.</code></li>
<li>Buses and trains will be electric by 2030, while taxes and regulations will be imposed to force people to buy smaller, lighter and less-powerful cars.
<code>Trains also kill far fewer people than cars, lets have more of them.</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Health</h1>
<ul>
<li>prescription charges abolished. A new <span class="caps">NHS</span> Tax will be introduced specifically to fund the health service.
 <code>Universal free healthcare is essential, not just diagnosis.</code></li>
<li>Assisted dying will be legalised, and the law on abortion liberalised to allow nurses to carry it out. Private healthcare will be more heavily taxed, with special levies on private hospitals that employ staff who were trained on the <span class="caps">NHS</span>.
<code>Good. Assisted dying is none of the state's business, nor is a woman's body.</code></li>
<li>It will be a criminal offence, with “significant fines”, to stop a woman from breastfeeding in a restaurant or shop, and formula milk will be more tightly regulated.
<code>Excellent.</code></li>
<li>In order to prevent “overpopulation” burdening the earth, the state will provide free condoms and fund research for new contraceptives.
<code>It's estimated the earth can, at current levels of comfort, hold 10 billion people, and we'll reach that point before the end of the centary. I quite like my level of comfort.</code></li>
<li>A Green party would impose “research, education and economic measures” to drive a “transition from diets dominated by meat”.
<code>Meat's difficult to automate the production of, which is our only chance at feeding all of us this century! Steak's nice, but I'll take not starving over it any day of the week.</code></li>
<li>Factory farming would be abolished, and the sale of fur criminalised and shooting banned. Whips and jumps would be banned from horse racing
<code>Cruelty. Cruelty will be banned.</code></li>
</ul>
<h1><span class="caps">AID</span></h1>
<ul>
<li>International aid should be increased by nearly 50 per cent to one per cent of <span class="caps">GDP</span> under Green Policy.
<code>How kind.</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>National&nbsp;Security</h1>
<ul>
<li>Merely being a member of al-Qaeda, the <span class="caps">IRA</span> and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence under Green plans, and instead a Green Government should seek to “address desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ‘terrorist’,” the policy book states.
<code>So we're going to TALK to these people? How's that going to solve anything?</code></li>
<li>Terrorism, it adds, “is an extremely loaded term. Sometimes governments justify their own terrorist acts by labelling any groups that resist their monopoly of violence &#8216;terrorist’.”
<code>indeed.</code></li>
<li>Britain will leave <span class="caps">NATO</span>, end the special relationship with the <span class="caps">US</span>, and unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons. A standing army, navy and airforce is “unnecessary”. Bases will be turned into nature reserves and the arms industry “converted” to producing wind turbines.
<code>Given that the nessesity for the UK to protect itself at war for the past 50 years has been none: A standing army is of not use. When it is not needed, it finds a use anyway. See iraq, syria, afganistan etc etc.</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Immigration</h1>
<ul>
<li>“Richer regions do not have the right to use migration controls to protect their privileges from others in the long term,” the party’s policy book states.
<code>Global thinking in action.</code></li>
<li>A Green Government will “progressively reduce” border controls, including an amnesty for illegal immigrants after five years.
<code>Good.</code></li>
<li>Access to benefits, the right to vote and tax obligations will apply to everyone living on British soil, regardless of passport. The policy book states: “We will work to create a world of global inter-responsibility in which the concept of a &#8216;British national&#8217; is irrelevant and outdated.”
<code>Indeed. There is no place for nationalism in a modern society.</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Political&nbsp;Mechanics</h1>
<ul>
<li>Political parties will be funded by the state.
<code>To stop lobbying by corporations.</code></li>
<li>The electoral system changed. [to what, <span class="caps">AV</span>?]
<code>The greens support an Alternative Vote system, that finally throws out the stupid two-party mechanics that plague our system.</code></li>
<li>The monarchy will be abolished.
<code>As head of state. A democracy has no interest in unelected officials being in power.</code></li>
</ul>
